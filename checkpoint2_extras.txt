## Implemented extras

### Semantic:

- while (condition must be of type boolean)
- if (condition must be of type boolean)
- return type mismatch (type of value given to return must match the return type of the method)
- attribution type mismatch (left hand side and right hand side of atribution must have the same type)
- variables must be declared before they are initialized
- variables must be initialized before they are used
- 'this' cannot be used in a static context (main function)

### Code Generation:

- instance creation (e.g. `Person p; p = new Person();`)
- local variable declaration
- local variable loading
- local variable storing
- parameter loading
